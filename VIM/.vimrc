" Overview:
" - I use vim 7 in xterminals (gnome-terminal, console, gvim, etc) on light
"   backgrounds.
" - In non-xterminals (like the typical linux terminal) I use dark
"   backgrounds.
" - Generally, I don't change default vim keyboard shortcuts, such that I can
"   use 'pristine' vim installations as well.
" - I enable all the 'cool' features: code folding, syntax highlighting,
"   automatic complete, filetype plugins, indentation, line numbering, custom
"   ruler, custom status line.
" - Even if I use gvim, I actually don't use the GUI features. I disable
"   pretty much everything, except the menus.
" - I use vim modelines.
" - I use the longer names for commands and settings (e.g. 'tabstop' instead
"   of 'ts'), for readability.
" - When saving files the RD_FileWritePre() function checks for $Date: ... $
"   to update the date.
" - I enabled .exrc/.vimrc files per-directory, and I disabled any unsafe
"   commands in such files.
" - New keyboard shortcuts:
"   _' _{ _( _[ _< _t _W _T _c _C _"
"   These are selection wrappers. Select something and type _' to have single
"   quotes around the selection. In normal mode type _W to unwrap the string.
"   For example move over the ' single quote character and type _W: this will
"   remove the ' and the other matching quote.
"   _t and _T are for XML/HTML tags. _t to wrap the selection around a given
"   tag name. _T to strip the tag under the cursor.
"   _c and _C are for comments. It will detect the file type and use propers
"   comments.
" - New command: Fullscreen. Nice for editing text-only documents.
" - I use the matchit and taglist plugins. I do not use XML edit plugins.
" - I have my own XML edit functions, which I like better than those available
"   online in other scripts.
" - New abbreviations:
"   isodate
"   Adds the date in ISO format: 2008-11-04 22:43:09 +0200.
"
"   $Date$
"   Adds the date in ISO format, with a twist: $Date: 2010-12-02 22:56:42 +0530 $ 
"
"   rdcopy
"   My usual 'copyright' notice.
"
" Problems:
" - _c and _C (comment wrapping) is not very good at the moment.
" - XML/HTML editing still needs improvements, but it's usable.
